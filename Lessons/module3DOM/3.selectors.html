<!-- //when we go to console and we do document that means it is refering to this html web page

//getting element by id  =>  let a=   document.getElementBYId("container")
so a has whole div with id container in it -->

<!-- a.id = container -->
 <!-- so now using this we can access any property of div -->
<!-- a.class will give null as class is internally named as className in DOM -->
 <!-- a.className='header' -->


 <!-- a.getAttribute("id") will give value of id of a 
 a.getAttribute("class") will give value of class of a  -->



<!-- we can set attribute too 

a.setAttribute("id","main")
so now a will have id main and its is overwritten on previous id

a.setAttribute("class",'new')
now a is overwritten with class new , but if we want it to include previous class also which was "header"

a.setAttribute("class","new header")
now both will be there.
 
-->



<!-- We can add styling in the elements too using dom
  
a.style.backgroundColor="red"

a.style.padding="30px"
-->



<!-- We can extract as well as manipulate the text  of our selected element

    suppose we have selected paragraph with id para
    let p=document.getElementById("para")

    p.innerText will be 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sunt, doloremque?' 
    //since the text inside span is hidden as span has display none so innerText only extracts the thing which is visible in our element


    p.textContent will be 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur hello there adipisicing elit. Sunt, doloremque?'
    //so it extracted all the text content inside our element no matter is is displayed none or not


    p.innerHTML  will be  'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur <span style="display:none">hello there </span>adipisicing elit. Sunt, doloremque?'
    //so it went inside p which means in between opening and closing tag whatever there text or html it will bring that all.

    we can change these values as we want.



-->

<!-- document.getElementsByClassName
 
will give an HTML collection
-->


<!-- querySelector(selector) 
 will give single element that has this selector and if many has the same selector first one will be returned

 let heading2= document.querySelector(".head2")
 using querySelector we can use any of selectors we learnt in css to find our element

 let inp=document.querySelector("input[type='email']")

 we can find anything using it
 
-->

<!-- chaining selectors

let ulist=document.querySelector("ul")

let li1=ulist.querySelector("li")

li1.style.backgroundColor="green"
li1.innerText="Ten"
 -->

 <!-- querSelectorAll()
  it is used to select many elements based on a selector it return nodelist which looks like an array but there are differences b/w array and nodelist like in prototype of array we have lots of methods but in prototype of nodelist we have only some methods.

  let list= document.querySelectorAll("li")
  list.forEach((item)=>{
  item.style.backgroundColor="cornflowerblue"})
  

  All though nodelist is not an array but to acess an element we use list[0] so it has some similarities of array
 -->



<!-- read about nodelist , array and htmlcollection difference -->
 <!-- The main difference between a NodeList and an HTMLCollection is that:

NodeList can contain any type of node, including element, text, and comment nodes, while HTMLCollection only contains element nodes.
NodeList can be either static or live, depending on how it's created (e.g., querySelectorAll() returns a static NodeList, while childNodes is live). In contrast, an HTMLCollection is always live and updates automatically when the DOM changes.
NodeList can be iterated using forEach(), while HTMLCollection requires a regular loop (for or while) for iteration.
Neither NodeList nor HTMLCollection have Array methods like map() or filter(), but both can be converted into an Array using Array.from(). -->

<!-- Converting NOdelist to array

let nl= document.querySelectorAll("p")

let nlArr= Array.from(nl)

now it is converted in array so we can use any method of array like filter, map reduce etc in it.

similarly html collections can also be converted in arrays.
 
-->


<!-- in nodelist we can use forEach but in HTMLCollection we can't as it is not present in its prototype -->
