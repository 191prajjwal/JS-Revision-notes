<!-- //the image DOM.png is the DOM structure of our webpage
//DOM means document object model
//so as soon we open any webpage in browser , the browser creates one document for it in the form of nodes and objects. here each separate tag attribute or entity is treated as node which will be useful while applying dynamicallity in webpage using Javascript.
//so DOM is basically created so that our whole html page is binded together in parent child manner so that we can visit and manipulated any neeeded element. -->
