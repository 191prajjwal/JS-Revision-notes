   //if we click it before 3s then the settimeout will be cleared and will not be executed but we have to say which timeout to clear hence give its reference to it by storing the settimeout in a variable and passing it to clear timeout.
   //the variable usually stores number like which settimeout we are refering to like 1 or 2 or 3.
